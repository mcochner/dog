# dog
dog.sh is a shell script that recursively lists files in a specified directory. It prints each file’s contents and can optionally copy everything to your clipboard. It’s especially useful for quickly sharing code snippets with ChatGPT or any other LLM. Take that, cat—this dog can fetch all your files at once!
